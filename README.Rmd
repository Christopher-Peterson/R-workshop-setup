This document will walk you through the steps of installing R, RStudio, and Git, connecting git to RStudio, and installing some of the necessary R packages for the workshop.  

# Install R

**Required Version: `r r_min_ver` or higher**

R is an interpreter that runs scripts written in the R language; it needs to be installed, but you generally won't work with it directly.

Go to the [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) (Comprehensive R Archive Network) website and click the download link for your operating system. 

For Windows, click "base," then "Download R (version) for Windows. Open the installer and follow the instructions. For Mac OS X, click the `.pkg` file under "Latest Release" and follow the instructions on the page.  For Linux, follow the page instructions and contact me if you have questions.

**If you already have R on your system**

Open R and check the version number (it should be the first thing that pops up).  If it is below `r r_min_ver`, you'll need to install R again (follow the instructions above).  

# Install RStudio

RStudio is a development environment that simplifies and automates a lot of lot of tedious things that working with R usually requires.  It will be your primary interface with the R language

**Required Version: `r rst_min_ver` or higher**

[Download RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) for the appropriate operating system and install it.  You should make sure you have R installed first.  

If you already have RStudio installed, go to Help -> About RStudio to check the version number.  I recommend version `r rst_rec_ver`, but `r rst_min_ver` will work for what we're doing.

# Install Git

Git is a version control system that is used to manage changes in files for projects.  I'll be routinely updating the files associated with this course, and Git is the easiest way to make sure you have the most recent versions of everything.

[Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for your operating system, and follow the instructions on the installer.

## Connect Git to RStudio

Create an account on [Github](https://github.com/join), if you don't already have one. Go to the [SSH Keys](https://github.com/settings/keys) page in your GitHub account settings. Click the "New SSH Key" button, and give it a title that matches whatever computer you're using.  Keep the page open and switch back to RStudio.

In RStudio, go to **Tools -> Global Options** and click **Git/SVN**.  Check the **Enable  version control interface for RStudio projects** box. Apply the changes.

If nothing is listed under *Git executable*, click browse and find where git (or git.exe) has been installed. On Windows, it's usually something like `C:/Program Files (x86)/Git/bin/git.exe`.  For Linux/OS X, click the "Terminal" tab in the low-right pane of RStudio and type `which git` to find the location.  

If the SSH RSA key box is not empty, click **View Public Key** and skip to the next paragraph.  Otherwise, click **Create RSA Key**. Using passphrase will be more secure but also less convenient (you'll have to enter it every time you download new files). No password will still create a secure connection to the remote server (in this case, GitHub), but that connection can be compromised if someone else gains access to your computer.  If you're only setting things up for this workshop, it's probably okay not not use a passphrase, but I'd recommend going back and revisiting that if you end up using git a lot more. Click the link in the RSS dialogue for more information (and some more secure options).

Click **Create** and you'll see a large textbox with an RSA public key.  Copy this, switch back to the Github SSH Key browser window, and paste it in **Key** the box.  Click **Add SSH Key**.

Restart Rstudio.

## Check if it works

From the [main page](https://github.com/Christopher-Peterson/R-workshop-setup) of this GitHub repository, click the green **⤓Code** button in the upper corner.  From the drop-down menu, click **Use SSH**, then copy the text in the box.  

In RStudio, click File -> New Project -> Version Control -> Git.  Paste what you copied (Ctrl+V or Cmd+V) into the first text box; feel free to use the other boxes to change where the files will be downloaded. 

Switch to the **Files** tab in RStudio (it should be in one of the panes on the right, unless you've customized things).  You should see a list of files including `.gitignore`, `README.md`, `README.Rmd`, and `workshop_setup.Rproj`.  If so, congratulations, this worked.

# Installing R packages

Create a new script in R (Ctrl+Shift+N or Cmd+Shift+N).  Type this on the first line, then hit Ctrl+Enter (or Cmd+Enter on Mac); this will run the code:

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```

If you get an error message, you don't have the tidyverse package; run this code:

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

This should produce a message like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
── Attaching packages ───────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.0 ──
✓ ggplot2 3.3.0           ✓ purrr   0.3.4      
✓ tibble  3.0.1           ✓ dplyr   1.0.0
✓ tidyr   1.0.2           ✓ stringr 1.4.0      
✓ readr   1.3.1           ✓ forcats 0.4.0      
── Conflicts ──────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
x dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()
```

The `tidyverse` package organizes a bunch of other packages that work well together. If you've installed any of them previously, they may be out of date; check the versions listed and make sure they're at least as high as the ones in this table:


```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
  knitr::kable(tidy_versions)
```

If they aren't, restart your R session (Session -> Restart R), then use `install.packages()` for each one you need to install. (Be sure to put the package name in quotation marks).  

We will also be using the `cowplot` package, which is not part of `tidyverse`.  Use `packageVersion("cowplot")` to see if you have the package installed and if its version number is at least `r cowplot_ver`.  If not, use `install.packages("cowplot")` to fix it.
